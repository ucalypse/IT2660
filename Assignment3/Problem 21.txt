Write a program to evaluate an arithmetic expression
written in postfixed notation.  The 
arithmetic expression will be input as a 
String (by the user) and will contain only
integer operands.  Use the following
code sequence to parse the integers and
the operators from the input string,
mathExpression:

import java.util;
String thisToken;
StringTokenizer tokens = new String(mathExpression);
while(tokens.hasMoreTokens())
{
thisToken = tokens.nextToken();
}
