Code an Application program that keeps track of student information at your college including
their names, identification numbers, and G.P.A. In
a fully encapsulated, homogenous singly linked
list.  When launched, the user will be asked to input the initial
number of students and the initial data set.  Once this is
complete, the user will be presented with the 
following menu:
Enter:  1 to insert a new student's information
 	2 to fetch and output a student's information
	3 to delete a student's information
	4 to update a student's information
	5 to output all the student information
	6 to exit the program

The program should perform an unlimited number of operations until the user
enters 6 exit the program.  If the user requests an operation on a node not in the structure,
the program output should be "node not in structure."  Otherwise the message "operation complete"
should be output.
